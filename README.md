# Forms Be Relative
This game is a puzzle platformer. I've managed to create five levels, but more would be needed in order for the game to be complete. Adding new levels is easy and I look forward to adding different mechanics.

An executable for MacOS is in the `Executables` folder.

## Controls
Move Right  : D / ->

Move Left   : A / <-

Jump        : Space

Continue    : Enter / Return

Access Menu : Escape

## Inventory System
While I don't have an inventory system, I do save the current level in PlayerPrefs and it is possible to continue playing where you left off after a game restart. To do so, simply press the `Continue` button from the main menu. Based on QA in class, I believe this should qualify as the mentioned extra credit inventory system.

## Graphics / Audio
I created all the music and sound effects myself.
The game-style lends itself to basic graphics, so the sprites I created were very simple in nature. I also created the splash screen, all of it using Krita.
